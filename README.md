# UI Bootcamps
## HTML - CSS - JavaScript _(Angular oriented :wink:)_

![Globant](assets/globant.jpg)

## __IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER__
This is not your typical _crash course_, this is a **Bootcamp**.

What does that mean?

- _You will give your best_

- _We will give our best_

- _We will all have a good time_


But most important, there will be **A LOT** of humor, because a happy developer _(student, pupil, padawan, you get the point...)_ is a great and hard working developer.


_That said..._


## Welcome to the bootcamp, learning time has begun

![Workout](assets/workout.gif)

Please, use this repository as a base for all your work. The idea is to
fork this project so everyone uses the same folder structure for the
exercises.

account. Also you can read further about Git in
[Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) or
[Learn Git Branching](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/)

5. Fork this repo to use as a base to host the project code.

→ [index](#index)

### Bootcamp Schedule

The Bootcamp is organized in the following way:

![Calendar](assets/calendar-new2.png)

Week 0 is a representation of what should the attendant already know. 
Basics around HTML, CSS and JavaScript are pretended.

The first week reviews Week 0 knowledge to make sure all of us are on the same page.
Also dives deep into `JavaScript` and some `Node.js` _mumbo jumbo_ + `Express`.

The second week introduces you to AngularJS and TypeScript. 
There are several AngularJS apps laying around, so diving into some
core concepts is useful. JavaScript is an easy typed language, that means
as a developer you have total control over the whole structure of the code. Sometimes that's an advantage, but as the app grows and more people become involved things go out of hand.
That's when TypeScript comes to the rescue, and some concepts will be studied during this week too.

The third week continues with some TypeScript concepts and introduces Angular 5.
At this point you will start with the famous `Tour of Heroes` app.

The last week will be focused on two things: more Angular 5 core concepts, and starting an app and learning some _shiny cool_ stuff. You need to present your work at the end of the week, _however_
you can keep working on it (more on that later).

### You will encounter some pages with extra excercises on them. You have the power to choose if you want to do them or not. Just remember, if you do, put them on the [extra folder](src/extra)

→ [index](#index)

### General Guidelines

1. [Team play](http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/ten-qualities-of-an-effective-team-player.html) is encouraged but the work will be evaluated per person.

2. The instructions will be vague as they generally are in real life projects.
You must look for support and guidance from your PM, teammates and tutors.

3. All code and documentation must be in English.

4. `HTML` syntax must adhere to Globant's [HTML Style Guide](https://github.com/globant-ui/html-style-guide).

5. `CSS` code must adhere to Globant's [CSS Style Guide](https://github.com/globant-ui/css-style-guide)

6. `Js` code must adhere to Globant's [Js Style Guide](https://github.com/globant-ui/JavaScript-style-guide).

7. `Ts` and `Angular` code must adhere to [Angular's Style Guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide).

→ [index](#index)

### Learning Days ###

Each day you will grab the fundamentals of building blocks for usual
`Js/Ts/Angular` applications.

On each learning day you will have to:

1. **Read:**
We will provide you with documentation related with current sprint content so
you can have a background reference, guide and examples to complete the
following practice.

2. **Practice:**
You will implement the previously gathered knowledge in simple coding activities.

3. **Commit:**
You will commit all your code on a daily basis, when you finish your practice. This will not apply for code of Week 3 and 4.

# Introduction

  - This repository contains inside the `src` directory the project structure for all exercises/challenges that you will
  need to do.

  - All `.js` code can be opened directly on the browser. For Ts and Angular code you will need to run a Liteserver with
  the Angular CLI. Just running `ng serve` or `npm run serve` will be enough

  - Once the server is running, all the modifications you make will be automagically synced and the app will reload.

_Now let's get down to business_

# Week 0: HTML, CSS and JavaScript (OPTIONAL)

## Day 0: _At the beginning it wasn't all HTML & CSS_

So, what's _day 0_?

We as developers know that every structure starts at `0` (any other dev or language that says the contrary is ___WRONG___) so this is the first thing you'll need to master before even trying to fight with the future topics.

### History time

Rumor has it that when the web was a little baby, at the early stages of `web 1.0` all was static and **SOOO** ugly.

You may have encounter one of those exquisite pages:

![Mr x page](assets/mrxPage.jpg)

_YES_ pages looked like that _(and that's a pretty one)_ - all old HTML and CSS

Fortunately people noticed that we needed new tools to create more dynamic and stylish experiences. Technologies have evolved and now we can make gorgeous experiences like [this one](https://feeddart.com/). Regardless, the basics are still the same.

### Let's get on with it

`HTML` describes the content semantics and structure of a web page. It was designed as a markup language, if you know XML ~~(the ugly father)~~, you could consider HTML as a subset of XML with a predefined semantic _(and soooo much friendly)_.

On the other hand, CSS allows to define the look and feel of the content. It's used to set colors on HTML elements, customize sizes, define the layout of the document content, among others. (e.x. "The following list of elements must be shown as a menu", "The main title of the page should use this particular font", "_make things pretty_").

JavaScript is a programming language that runs in all Web Browsers. Using JavaScript we can create full-fledge web applications (_and some magic_).

### Reading:
- Some other Globbers made this ~~meme-less~~ awesome [HTML & CSS 101](https://github.com/globant-ui/css-lab).

### Exercise:
Despite this is supposed to be just a review, you've got some exercises to do if you want.
You can find them at [HTML & CSS 101](https://github.com/globant-ui/css-lab).
Just put all your work under [hmtl-css-review](src/week0/hmtl-css-review)

### ~~Not so~~ Optional Reading
- [Responsive Design](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive/)
- [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction#what-are-web-components)
- [Why use Web Components](https://medium.com/@gilfink/why-im-betting-on-web-components-and-you-should-think-about-using-them-too-8629396e27a)
- This is your new best friend, [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/). The best responsive-friendly CSS model.

→ [index](#index)

## Day 0.2 - 0.5: Hello JavaScript

_Yes, I know I missed the other days, but c'mon. I'm giving you space to learn._

I'm sure you must be an HTML & CSS guru by now, right?

![This is fine](assets/thisIsFine.gif)

So, are you ready for your new challenge? `Js`

_JavaScript is an event driven programming language that runs in all Web Browsers. Using JavaScript we can create full-fledge web applications._

That's quite a definition, buy our friends at [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/00_intro.html#h_GlF1Kuv0JF) make an even better work.

I hope you liked that book, because it's going to stick with us for the rest of this (and next) week.

### Reading:

- [Js Values, Types, and Operators](http://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html)
- [Js Program Structure](http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html)
- [Js Functions](http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html)
- [Js Data Structures: Objects and Arrays](http://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html)

### Exercise:

I think you've noticed by now, but there are a few exercises inside the reading material (awesome, I know). As we said before, this is just a review but if you want you can do them!
Just put all your work under [javascript-review](src/week0/javascript-review) once you finished the exercises on page.

→ [index](#index)

# Week 1: Diving into JavaScript and Node 101

## Day 1: The Secret Life of Objects

![Suspicious](assets/suspicious.gif)

`Js` is often called an Object oriented language, but actually that isn't 100% true. In `Js`
we have what's called `Prototipal Inheritance`.
In this lesson you will learn all about the Prototype, Inheritance, Getters, Setters, Constructors and Polymorfism.

### Reading:

- [Objects](http://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html)

### Exercise:

Look into [`src/week1/day1/index.html`](src/week1/day1/index.html) in there there's an `Animal` class with a talk method. Follow the instructions.

### ~~Not So~~ Optional Reading
Since ES6 went out we do have a _Class like_ sintax, **HOWEVER** that's [Syntactic Sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar).
We still have that ~~hideous~~ beautiful `Prototype` under the hood, so don't get confused.

- [ES6 Class Sintax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)

→ [index](#index)



## Day 2: Going Regular with RegEx (Also, learn how to hunt those bugs)
One of the most ~~hated~~ used features on any kind of language are Regular Expressions, aka RegEx. Those are **REALLY** powerfull strings (they are more like a really special kind of strings) that allow you to capture any pattern you want on any kind of string. You can make sure all emails accounts end up with `@something.com` or all the names are at most 4 characters long... you get the idea.

Also, you will be learning error handling and some of the finest debugging techniques out there. Or, as I like to call them, **_learn how to properly use your tools_**.

Read up and catch 'em all

![Catch](assets/catch.gif)

### Reading:
- [Regular Expressions](http://eloquentjavascript.net/09_regexp.html)
- [An Introduction to Regular Expressions (Regex) In JavaScript](https://codeburst.io/an-introduction-to-regular-expressions-regex-in-javascript-1d3559e7ac9a)
- [Errors and debugging](http://eloquentjavascript.net/08_error.html)

### Exercise:
Look into [`src/week1/day2`](src/week1/day2) in there there're some `index` files, poke around and follow the instructions.

→ [index](#index)


## Day 3: The browser, where the _magic_ happens

So, you have a text file called _whatever.js_, you have ~200 lines in there (or you should, codebases of ~ 1k lines are made by horrible people). You add it to an `index.html` file, double click that file, a browser opens and

![Mindblown](assets/mindblown.gif)

The code comes to life. All works fine (at least if you coded right :unamused:) it's

![Magic](assets/magic.gif)

No, no it's not. It's the browser's engine. `Js` runs inside a browser on a [VM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine), that VM could be
[V8](https://developers.google.com/v8/) (Chrome), [SpiderMonkey](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey) (Firefox), [Chakra](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore) (Edge) or [Nitro](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore) (Safari)

For day 3 you will learn about the Browser, the Document Object Model (basically the whole thing you are seeing on the browser's window) and DOM Events.

### Reading:

- [The Browser](http://eloquentjavascript.net/12_browser.html)
- [DOM](http://eloquentjavascript.net/13_dom.html)
- [Events](http://eloquentjavascript.net/14_event.html)

If you used jQuery, this is the time you realize that it's not so magic, it's Js, and you can do all the things jQuery does with vanilla Js. And in a few weeks you'll be refusing to use jQuery again :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

### ~~Not So~~ Optional Reading
The browser and the server (the little computer thingy that lives on the cloud and has all your files) communicates via `HTTP`. That's a protocol, something like a standarized way to send messages. You can read more about it here:

- [HTTP](http://eloquentjavascript.net/17_http.html)

Users communicate with the application via `forms`, those are fill up sections which where designed on a time before `Js` where all interactions with the server where made while navigating to a new page. That kind of interaction is **SO** web 1.0 but, we still use `forms`.

- [Forms](http://eloquentjavascript.net/18_forms.html)

- [Design patterns](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns), the blueprints to a reliable application.

- [4 JavaScript Design Patterns You Should Know](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/4-javascript-design-patterns-you-should-know)


### Exercise:
Look into [`src/week1/day3`](src/week1/day3) in there there're some `index` files, poke around and follow the instructions.

→ [index](#index)



## Day 4 and 5: require('Node.js')
So, at this point you pretty much are up to speed with `Js`. But `Js` does not only run on a
browser. **YES** you read me right, you can make a `server`, a `robot`, a `game`, you
can eve run it on an _Arduino_. The sky's the limit.

![Excited](assets/excited.gif)

How is that even possible you ask? Well, `Js` community was aways **HUGE**, so it was more than expected that a person asked `Why not?`
That's how [`Node`](https://nodejs.org/en/) was born.

`Node.js` is a `Js` runtime that runs outside the browser on a V8 VM, there's a Node fork for almost everything.

### Reading
First, to understand how node works, you need to learn one last thing about `Js`, `Modules`

- [Modules](http://eloquentjavascript.net/10_modules.html)

Then you can go on with this
- [Node](http://eloquentjavascript.net/20_node.html)

After that you can learn about the most popular NodeJS framework:
- [Express](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction#Introducing_Express)

### ~~Not So~~ Optional Reading
- [What is npm?](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm)
- [Installing npm packages locally](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally)
- [Using a `package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json)
- [Updating local packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/updating-local-packages)
- [Uninstalling local packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/uninstalling-local-packages)
- [Installing npm packages globally](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-globally)
- [Updating global packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/updating-global-packages)
- [Uninstalling global packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/uninstalling-global-packages)
- [Semantic versioning and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/semantic-versioning)
- [How npm works?](https://docs.npmjs.com/how-npm-works/npm3)

### Exercise:
Look into [`src/week1/day4-5`](src/week1/day4-5) in there there're some `js` files. Those 2 are `Node.js` apps, they don't work as you would expect from any other `.js` file.
You will need to use the command line:
```
luca.sartori@AR-IT12688:~/bootcamps/ui$
```
That's your Command Line Interface, know your CLI, love your CLI, **BE** your CLI. A developer is defined by it's tools, and you will want this one on your side.

You'll need to navigate to `src/week1/day4-5`
```
luca.sartori@AR-IT12688:~/bootcamps/ui$ cd src/week1/day4-5/
```
If you excecute a `ls` command you'll se the contents on the CLI
```
luca.sartori@AR-IT12688:~/bootcamps/ui/src/week1/day4-5/$ ls

expressDemo.js  fsDemo.js  node_modules  package.json

```
Then, you have to run one of the files
```
luca.sartori@AR-IT12688:~/bootcamps/ui/src/week1/day4-5/$ node fsDemo.js
```
[**Remember, you'll need Node.js installed**](#materials)

That will run the code, just remember two things
1. Server code, like the one from [expressDemo](/src/week1/day4-5/expressDemo.js) keeps running, you have to exit it
2. To exit a running process on the CLI, you need to press `CTRL+C`

**Notes:**

Don't be afraid to Google stuff, no developer remembers everything

# Week 2: angularJS and TypeScript 101

## Day 6, 7 and 8: angularJS double the binding!
This Bootcamp will focus around `Angular` that does not mean that you should stop there, if you want to dig into `React` please do, it'll help you in the future.

AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly. AngularJS's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write, and it all happens within the browser.

It attempts to minimize the impedance mismatch between document centric HTML and what an application needs by creating new HTML constructs. AngularJS teaches the browser new syntax through a construct we call directives.

We will focus on some core elements:

- Directives
- Factory
- Services
- Modules
- Digest Cycle

__1. Directives__

At a high level, directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) that tell AngularJS's HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element, or even to transform the DOM element and its children.

__2. Factory__

In AngularJS, services are reusable singleton objects that are used to organize and share code across your app. They can be injected into controllers, filters, directives. AngularJS provides you three ways : service, factory and provider to create a service.

Basically, a factory is a simple function which lets you to add some logic before creating the object, and then it returns the object.

__3. Services__

Angularjs Services are functions or objects and are used to do specific tasks. This makes them an individual entity which is maintainable and testable. These are singletons. Services are injected using Dependency Injection Mechanism of Angularjs. Services provide a method for us to keep data around the lifetime of the app and communicate across controllers in a consistent manner.

__4. Modules__

A module is a collection of providers, services, directives, and optionally config and run blocks which get applied to the application during the bootstrap process.

__5. Digest Cycle__

Also called digest loop, it's process of detecting model changes. The name comes from the function $digest that is available on scope instances.
Digest cycle goes through all the scope objects like Angular expressions or directives and checks which objects got affected due to the activity performed by the user.

### Reading
- [Directives](https://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/creating-custom-angularjs-directives-part-i-the-fundamentals)
- [Factory](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/providers#factory-recipe)
- [Services](https://www.airpair.com/javascript/posts/services-in-angularjs-simplified-with-examples)
- [Modules](https://www.journaldev.com/6125/angularjs-module-tutorial-example)
- [Digest Cycle](http://www.geekhours.com/2016/07/08/understanding-the-digest-cycle-in-angularjs/)

### ~~Not So~~ Optional Reading
- [Service vs Factory](https://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2015/07/07/service-vs-factory-once-and-for-all.html)

### Excercise
So let's start our engines and get coding.

![Engines](assets/engines.gif)

This is your first app, so we are going to give you hand here.

Have you heard about generators? Basically they are this magic thingy that makes magic and creates a full
app skeleton for you. That includes, scaffolding, test, automatization task, etc. One of the most popular is
[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/).

You are going to use [Yeoman's AngularJS Generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular) to create your app.

Basically you need to install some dependencies
```bash
npm install -g grunt-cli bower yo generator-karma generator-angular
```

_NOTE_

If you are planning on using Sass, you will need to first install Ruby and Compass:

- Install Ruby by downloading from [here](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) or use Homebrew
- Install the compass gem:
``` bash
gem install compass
```
_END NOTE_

Make a new directory, and `cd` into it:
``` bash
mkdir my-new-project && cd $_
```

Run yo angular, optionally passing an app name:
```bash
yo angular [app-name]
```

_IMPORTANT STUFF BELOW_

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview

Aaaaand.... that's it, you have a full AngularJS base app.

__NOW, HACK__

![Hackerman](assets/hackerman.gif)

You are going to do a [CRUD](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-crud) admin panel.

Nothing fancy, you just need to do:

- A list

![List](assets/list.jpg)

- A create modal (a page with id would be fine as well)

![Create](assets/create.jpg)


- An update modal (a page with id would be fine as well)

![Update](assets/update.jpg)

- A delete modal

![Delete](assets/delete.jpg)

__BONUS POINTS__

Use [Local Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to manage a variable (it can be anything on the UI, a button, a select list, a toggle)
that changes the color scheme (YES, A THEME TOGGLE).



## Day 9 and 10: TypeScript 101
So, here we are. This is the first step into a whole new world. It doesn't matter if it's [Angular](https://angular.io/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) or any `Js` framework. The latest generation of those tools makes the whole development process a breeze.
Welcome to the SPA world.

![New World](assets/newWorld.gif)

Here at Globant we are technology agnostic, every developer is welcomed to study anything he wants. However we do recommend from a maturity and scalabilty points of view `Angular` or `React`.

Let's start with [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/),  basically a superset of `Js`, with some advantages
1. Types
```
var number: number = 1;
var word: string = "1";

return number === word;
// IS NOT THE SAME

number = word;
// CAN'T BE DONE, DIFFERENT TYPES
```
2. Intellisense

![Intellisense](assets/intellisense.gif)

3. Generics - generic code for any type
```
class Greeter<T> {
    greeting: T;
    constructor(message: T) {
        this.greeting = message;
    }
    greet() {
        return this.greeting;
    }
}

let greeter = new Greeter<string>("Hello, world");

let button = document.createElement('button');
button.textContent = "Say Hello";
button.onclick = function() {
    alert(greeter.greet());
}

document.body.appendChild(button);
```
4. Transpilation - write in Ts, get ES6, ES5, ES4, etc...
![Transpilation](assets/transpilation.png)
[_Taken from Ts Playground_](http://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html)

Relax, you can always keep writing Js with TypeScript

And there's more and more... but that's for you to read:

### Reading:
- [TypeScript in 5 minutes](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)
- [Basic Types](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html)
- [Variable Declarations](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/variable-declarations.html)

→ [index](#index)



# Week 3: TypeScript and Angular 101

## Day 11: Still Ts
Get ready, there's a lot where the previous days came from.

### Reading
- [Interfaces](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html)
- [Classes](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/classes.html)
- [Generics](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html)
- [Enums](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html)
- [Type Inference](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-inference.html)
- [Type Compatibility](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-compatibility.html)
- [Advanced Types](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html)

**Notes:**

There is no excercise section on these two days because as this is a superset of `Js` you already know how it works. Take them as free days so you can digest all that new info about `Ts` specific features.

All `Ts` code will be evaluated with `Angular` as that's the language it uses.



## Day 11, 12, 13 and 14: Angular 101
So yes, here we are, `Angular`. The **ONE** framework (as they say) you may know it for it's previous generation, the highly important and famous _angular.js_.

_But as they say... water under the bridge._

`Angular` is a new framework, a new codebase and **A LOT** of new features. The team wanted _so bad_ to emphasize the _new_ part that the ditched the `.js` part of the name (commonly used on Js frameworks) and they adopted [_semver_](http://semver.org/).

The current stable version is 5.0

### ~~Not So~~ Optional Reading
- [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
- [Angular CLI Schematics](https://blog.angular.io/schematics-an-introduction-dc1dfbc2a2b2)

### Exercise:

The exercise for the week, is simple. We want you to be friends with `Angular`, so what's best than talking to each other?

You will do the `Tour of Heroes App` featured in the intro above. For that you'll have to follow the instructions on the page. However, as we want you to make the code, not copy/paste it there's a catch.

I've initialized the project for you, just run
```
luca.sartori@AR-IT12688:~/bootcamps/ui/week2$ npm install
```

_Remember: `ng serve` starts the app on `http://localhost:4200`_

_You will need to make a commit after every step, each one with a difference of at least 20 minutes. That way we can **at least try** to believe that you typed the code_

Keep in mind:
1. The app must be under [src/week2](src/week2)
2. You will need to install Angular CLI
3. You are expected to follow `Angular`'s code standards
4. Make a personal touch, you should be listed as a hero (cool powers only :grimacing:)

### Exercise:

![Show Me What You Got](assets/SMWYG.gif)

#### _It's time to make an app from scratch_

You are going to make a **Scientific app**.

#### MarsBoot: from mars to your screen

Let's get our requirements together:
- The app should be responsive
- You should make the app modular. There should be several components
- Here are some mockups for the app. You'll have a main screen and a photo detail page

Home

![Homepage](assets/nasaHome.jpg)

Detail

![Detail Page](assets/nasaDetail.jpg)

- [You'll have to use this API](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#MarsPhotos)
- Here's an API key for you to use `aZlmHCp3jD9sanwE8KvytidYArlTvlhwr3fEhYyM`
- Here are some API call examples
```
https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?sol=1000&api_key=DEMO_KEY

https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?sol=1000&camera=fhaz&api_key=DEMO_KEY

https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?sol=1000&page=2&api_key=DEMO_KEY
```

- You have several cameras
- You can change the camera displaying in a row
- You can click on an image and it'll get you to it's detail page (is the same page as the 'photo of the day' but with a different title)
- You can add any feature you like
- The photo of the day should be a __random__ picture from a __random__ camera

Create a week4 folder, go inside and run:
```
luca.sartori@AR-IT12688:~/bootcamps/ui/week4$ ng start
```

**_Hey, don't panic. This excercise is for this week and on..._**

You have until the last day of this week to keep pushing changes. After that you can keep workin on the app, but please create a new branch for it:
```
luca.sartori@AR-IT12688:~/bootcamps/ui/week4$ git checkout -b 'post-bootcamp'

luca.sartori@AR-IT12688:~/bootcamps/ui/week4$ git push origin post-bootcamp
```

Your app should look something like this:

Home

Detail

**Some advices**
- Dont't get scared. Even the most successfull Software Engineers and Architects forget things sometimes.
- Google is your friend, independence and curiosity are great values that every developer needs to have.
- The only way to learn is to fail, so keep failing.
- Theory is nice, but you need to get your hands dirty if you want things to stick.
- Remember, _a happy developer is a great developer_ (_also_, **coffee** is your best friend)

Kudos and keep ~~failing~~ learning!

# BONUS

So... you've got your `Angular` going, you read a **LOT** of stuff, you started a SPA. So... What's next?

![Homer Scholar](assets/homerSquareRoot.gif)

There're still a lot of stuff to read, some of them really work better under specific conditions or requirements. Remember:

_KEEP IT SIMPLE_

If there's a more advanced or complicated way to get to a solution it doesn't always mean that's the better approach.

With that in mind, here are some more advanced _(or not, this **whole** beatifull mess was made by a bored developer on a few days span)_ features that every one should know, and at least being able to explain them.

Hey, If you need a place to kill time try [Medium](medium.com), there's a lot to read about pretty much anything (specially development related topics). One of my favorites sections is [Angular in depth](https://blog.angularindepth.com/).
